    "# About the model\n",
    "\n",
    "This data generation model uses the normal distribution function to generate steps per hour for an individual. By adjusting the parameters given to the distribution function, multiple movement patterns (movement personalities) are generated that each will return a different number of steps made for the given hour. After retrieving the steps made for the given hour, the program adds a random number (jitter in the code) to represent the day to day fluctuations in an individuals movement. Lastly, the program adjusts for drift, meaning over time the individual will walk less and less, depending on the parameters given to the program. After 24 hours a new day starts and the provided (main) movement pattern might be used depending on the user input for the individual to have data generated for. The program generates two data sets for each individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first data set is used to make a simple solution of the Simulation Virtual Fitness Coach prediction without using data quality checks, visualisations, database, different algorithms, cross validation or visualisations. Soley the prepration of the fitbit data, model generation and saving the model. The prediction model code is written by Talko B. Dijkhuis, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction model is applied to the second data set to generate hourly based predictions. These predictions are used to simulate motivational messages and their effect on the number of steps taken the next hour. Depending on the selected motivational effect (specified parameters for the given individual) the effect will vary per day or per the given hours. The modified steps per hour and related variables are updated and the new data is saved in a new output file in order to preserve the original data set."

If needed, the movement patterns can be expanded in the future.\n",
